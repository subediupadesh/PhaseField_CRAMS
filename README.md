# PhaseField CRAMS : Phase Field - Corrosion Resistant Additive Manufacturing Simulations
## Description of the Repository PhaseField_CRAMS
Primary Austenite (gamma) phase is more resitant to pitting or crevice corrosion as compared to ferrite (alpha) phase. 
Ni is assumed to be an Austenite stabilizer.
This repository consists of the data and codes related to phase field simulations of pseudo binary formulation for Duplex stainless steel to unravel the process-structure relationship in additively manufactured microstructures.
The psudo-binary formulation for multicomponent steel is accomplished usign pyMPEALab toolkit [1].

The phase field simulations are performed in [MOOSE framework](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/).
